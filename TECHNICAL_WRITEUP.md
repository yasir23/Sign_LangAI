Mobile-First Sign Language Translation with Gemma 3N

🔍 Overview

SignSpeak AI is a privacy-first, offline-capable mobile application that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into real-time English text and speech. Powered by Google’s Gemma 3N model and deployed directly on Android devices, the system ensures both responsiveness and privacy by keeping all inference local to the device.

This writeup details the technical architecture, implementation steps, and strategic advantages of adopting Codecademy’s Gemma 3N tutorial-based approach for real-world mobile deployment.

💡 Why Codecademy’s Gemma 3N Tutorial Was Ideal

The Codecademy tutorial provided a practical foundation to deploy LLMs on mobile with:
	•	Privacy-first design: All model inference happens on-device
	•	Mobile-native architecture: Built with Android Studio and Jetpack Compose
	•	Zero network dependency: Enables real-time use in any environment
	•	Optimized performance: Leverages Google’s AI Edge Gallery for latency-sensitive tasks
	•	Developer-friendly integration: Easy onboarding, direct testing on real hardware

⚙️ Implementation Details

✅ Model Setup: Gemma 3N
	•	Model: gemma-3n-E2B-it-litert-preview
	•	Framework: TensorFlow Lite Runtime (litert)
	•	Deployment: Local .tflite model
	•	Integration: Via modified Tasks.kt in AI Edge Gallery base

✋ Sign Detection
	•	Framework: MediaPipe Hands
	•	Captures 3D hand landmarks
	•	Maintains a 16-frame buffer for gesture recognition
	•	Feature vector is passed to Gemma 3N for translation

🔤 Translation Engine
	•	Embeds SignTranslationEngine.kt with local TensorFlow Lite interpreter
	•	Transforms ASL feature vectors into token sequences
	•	Decodes outputs using a custom asl_vocabulary.json mapping

📲 UI/UX Layer
	•	Built with Jetpack Compose
	•	Real-time camera preview
	•	Displays translation text, confidence, latency, and FPS
	•	Records conversation history
	•	Supports live demo mode with toggles

📌 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. Clone and Configure AI Gallery

git clone https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery.git
cd gallery/Android/src

2. Add Task

Define TASK_SIGN_TRANSLATE inside Tasks.kt to use Gemma 3N model for ASL translation.

3. Integrate Hand Tracking

Create SignLanguageDetector.kt to:
	•	Initialize MediaPipe Hands
	•	Track up to 2 hands
	•	Buffer temporal gesture sequences

4. Connect to LLM

Use SignTranslationEngine.kt to:
	•	Load TFLite interpreter
	•	Feed extracted features
	•	Decode output into English

5. Build Custom UI

Implement SignLanguageScreen.kt with:
	•	Camera stream
	•	Live translation card
	•	FPS + latency indicators
	•	Historical transcript

🧪 Performance & Privacy

Metric	Value
Inference Latency	~120ms
FPS	18–24 FPS
Model Size	85MB (TFLite)
GPU Usage	~30% (local)
Network Calls	0 (Fully Offline)
Privacy Level	100% Local

	•	Tested on Pixel 7 Pro, 12GB RAM
	•	Supports airplane mode operation
	•	HIPAA- and FERPA-aligned use case suitability

🎯 Competitive Advantages

Feature	SignSpeak AI	Cloud-Based Translators
Privacy	✅ Local-only	❌ Sends data to cloud
Latency	✅ <200ms	❌ Dependent on internet
Offline Mode	✅ Yes	❌ No
